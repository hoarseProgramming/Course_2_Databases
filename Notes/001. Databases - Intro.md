# Databases - Intro

## Databases

We'll look at different databases. Starting with Microsoft SQL.

### What is a database?

Database is a collection of information organized to easily be able to search and alter parts of the informations.

DBMS is the software that is used to search an manipulate data in a database.

Different types of databases:

- We'll focus on relation databases (RDBMS).
	- Relation databases stores data in tables and often it is the relationships between different tables that is of importance. Hence, the name relation database.

### SQL (Structured query language)

A standardised programming language to get and modify data in Relation databases (RDBMS)

Different database handlers (Oracle, Postgres, MySQL) uses different dialects of SQL. The variations are often small.

We'll start by looking at the T-SQL (Transact-SQL) dialect, used by Microsoft SQL server.



### Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (MSSMS)

Client used to write our queries, and connect to databases.

### [SQL Commands](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dql-dml-dcl-tcl-commands/)
### Queries 

To get or alter data in a RDBMS we send queries to det server.

A query can be very simple or very complex.

In this lecture we'll look at some of the most common phrases used in queries.

```SQL
/* Tips
Ctrl+R shows or hide results
You can select what portion of query to execute. Just select text in editor and press execute.
SQL is not case sensitive!
Order of keywords is impportant!
*/

select * from students; -- gets data from server * = all

-- changes database
use ITHS;

select 
	-- Projection, how to show data found as columns
	[id], -- To select column, works in all SQL(?).
	"name", -- Needs to be used when column name has white space or special characters.
	id,
	10 + id as 'IDplus10',
	'hej ' + name as greeting
from 
	students
where	
	/* Selection: Selects what data to get
	Equality operators:

	= Equals
	<> not equal (But T-SQL also accepts !=)
	< less than
	> larger than
	<= less or equal
	>= larger or equal

	Logical operators:
	and (&&)
	or (||)
	not (|)
	*/
	id > 1 and id < 3; -- gets id, name, id,  10 + id, the greeting where id is larger than 1 and less than 3.

-- top = get specified number of rows, percent = percent of rows

select top 50 percent * from students;
-- Standard SQL: select * from students limit 50;

select * from students where id between 2 and 3;
select * from students where id >= 2 and id <= 3;

-- in
select * from students where name in ('Sven Svensson', 'Kalle Kallesson');

-- between
select * from students where name between 'a' and 's';

-- like
-- used when you want to match text fields to a specific pattern, ex: all textfields starting with 'B'.

/* 
% any string, 0 or more letters
_ one char, any
[] One char in a set or span: [abcd] / [a-d]
[^] Not char in a set or span: [^abcd] / [^a-d]
*/

select * from students where name like '[a-k]%';

-- changes database
use everyloop;

/* Order by
Sort results on one or more columns.
Last in expression.
ascending (asc) default. descending (desc) is the other option.
Sorts before selecting! Top 5 gets top 5 after sorting.
*/

select * from Users where len(FirstName) = 5 order by FirstName;

select * from Users order by FirstName desc, LastName asc; --asc

select top 5 * from Users order by FirstName desc;


-- distinct, gets every unique
select Region from Countries;

select distinct Region from Countries;

-- aliases: give new column name (as)

-- union all
-- get as same result

select country from Countries where country like 'a%'
union all
select firstname from Users where firstname like 'b%';

-- case-when
-- if, else if statement

select
	FirstName,
	len(firstname) as 'Length of firstname',
	case
		when len(firstname) < 4 then 'Short'
		when len(firstname) < 8 then 'Mid'
		else 'Long'
	end as 'Name length'
from 
	Users;

```


#### Null in SQL - means no value in column/row

**Data types**
- int = int
- nvarchar = string of n(unicode) charachters

**Primary key**
All tables may have a primary key. This column is unique - can't have duplicate values. Ex: Id

Best practice: All tables should have a primary key, and it should be the first column.


### Basic CRUD operations
**Create, Read, Update, Delete**

#### Safety precautions

Be careful when doing anything else than just selecting data. 

Check query many times before running updates and deletes.

Work with backups - but avoid needing to backup.

Do a select with same premise before your real operation to see that the selection is right.

Do a begin transaction before update/delete - can draw back changes if something went wrong.


```SQL

-- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete

-- Create 

-- insert into 

-- adds data to table
-- Syntax: (table) (columns) (values)
insert into students (id, name) values(4, 'Bengt Bengtsson');

-- inserts into all columns
insert into students values(5, 'Erik Eriksson', '0001-01-01');

-- choose which columns
insert into students (id, birthdate) values(6, '0006-06-06');

-- select into

-- Get rows and make a new table of the result
-- Need to refresh tables in database for the new one to show up!

select name, birthdate into newStudents from students where id > 3;

-- insert into select from

-- Takes data from one table and puts it in another table

insert into newStudents 
select name, birthdate from students where id < 3;

-- Read

select

-- Update

-- Change value on one or more rows in table.

update newStudents set name = 'test' where name like 'a%';

-- Delete

-- Remove one or more rows from table

delete from newStudents where birthdate = '0006-06-06';

-- Upsert

-- Mix of update and insert.
-- Row should update if it exists, otherwise it should be created.
```


### DDL commands
```SQL
-- creating databases

create database myDataBase;

use myDataBase;

-- creating tables

create table teachers
(
	id int primary key, 
	firstname nvarchar(max),
	lastname nvarchar(max),
	birthdate datetime2
)

insert into teachers (id, firstname) values(1, 'Fredrik');
insert into teachers (id, firstname) values(2, 'Angela');

delete from teachers where id = 2;

update teachers set lastname = 'Johansson' where id = 1;
update teachers set birthdate = '0001-01-01'

select * from teachers

-- Deleting tables/databases

drop table teachers;

-- Can't delete itself
drop database myDataBase;
```
