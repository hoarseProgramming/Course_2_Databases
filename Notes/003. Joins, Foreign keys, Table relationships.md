## [Relationships](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/relationships-in-sql-one-to-one-one-to-many-many-to-many/)

Relationships between tables, the common thing while working worth relationship data bases you have tables where data in one table have relations to data in other table.

Relationship types
- One-to-many: One country has alot of cities (primary key + foreign key)
- Many-to-many: Student and courses. A student can attend many classes, every class has alot of attendees. Needs junction tables

You want to separate data into different tables because otherwise you can get into problems:

![Shared table problems](bilder/Shared_Table_Problem.png)

Better:
![Different tables](bilder/Different_Tables.png)

You can join these together to get the result of the upper picture.


## Primary and foreign keys

We can join data as long as the tables share some column telling us about their relations.
You can join any columns as long they share anything.

But a common constraint is using primary and foreign keys.

(FörfattareID + ID in second table in example pictures)
Foreign key = points to another tables primary key.


## Joins

### Cross join: 

Not very common join to use. Example: Get all combinations of color and size of t-shirts.
All combinations represented table rows * table rows

### Inner join vs Full (outer) join

Inner join: Gets all matching primary + foreign keys
Full join: Gets all values, those who doesn't get a match = Null

![Inner join vs full join](Bilder/Inner_Join.png)

### Left (outer) join and Right (outer) Join

### Code Examples:

#### One-to-many join

```SQL

-------------------------- Joins -------------------------------

drop table countries;
drop table cities;

create table countries
(
	-- Should be primary key identity, but isn't 
	-- used here to be able to show different joins
	id int,
	name nvarchar(max)
);

insert into countries values(1, 'Sweden');
insert into countries values(2, 'Norway');
insert into countries values(3, 'Denmark');
insert into countries values(4, 'Finland');


create table cities
(
	id int,
	name nvarchar(max),
	countryId int
);

insert into cities values(1, 'Stockholm', 1);
insert into cities values(2, 'Gothenburg', 1);
insert into cities values(3, 'Malmö', 1);
insert into cities values(4, 'Oslo', 2);
insert into cities values(5, 'Bergen', 2);
insert into cities values(6, 'Copenhagen', 3);
insert into cities values(7, 'London', 8);

-------------------------- Inner join -------------------------------

select 
	-- We can choose columns we want here
	-- Using aliases
	ci.id,
	ci.name as 'City',
	co.name as 'Country',
	-- When unique column name, you don't need to use alias
	countryId
from 
	countries co
	-- join = default. => inner join
	-- Declare aliases
	join cities ci on co.id = ci.countryId

-------------------------- Left join -------------------------------

select 
	cities.id,
	cities.name as 'City',
	countries.name as 'Country'
from 
	countries
	left join cities on countries.id = cities.countryId

-------------------------- Right join -------------------------------

select 
	cities.id,
	cities.name as 'City',
	countries.name as 'Country'
from 
	countries
	right join cities on countries.id = cities.countryId

-------------------------- Full join -------------------------------

select 
	cities.id,
	cities.name as 'City',
	countries.name as 'Country'
from 
	countries
	full join cities on countries.id = cities.countryId
```

#### Many-to-many Join

```SQL

create table courses
(
	id int,
	name nvarchar(max)
)

insert into courses values(1, 'C#');
insert into courses values(2, 'Data bases');
insert into courses values(3, 'Javascript');
insert into courses values(4, 'Data handling');
insert into courses values(5, 'Clean code');

create table studentsJoinExample
(
	id int,
	name nvarchar(max)
)

insert into studentsJoinExample values(1, 'Pelle');
insert into studentsJoinExample values(2, 'Rafael');
insert into studentsJoinExample values(3, 'Frida');
insert into studentsJoinExample values(4, 'Julia');
insert into studentsJoinExample values(5, 'Gunnar');
insert into studentsJoinExample values(6, 'Hampus');
insert into studentsJoinExample values(7, 'Felicia');

create table coursesStudentsJoinExample
(
	courseId int,
	studentId int
)

insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(1, 1)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(1, 4)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(1, 5)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(1, 7)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(2, 1)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(2, 4)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(2, 5)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(3, 3)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(3, 7)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(3, 2)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(4, 4)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(4, 5)
insert into coursesStudentsJoinExample values(4, 7)

select * from courses
select * from studentsJoinExample
select * from coursesStudentsJoinExample

--------------- Join Many-to-many -----------------

select
	s.name as 'Student',
	count(c.name) as 'Number of courses'
from
	courses c
	join coursesStudentsJoinExample cs on c.id = cs.courseId
	join studentsJoinExample s on s.id = cs.studentId
group by 
	s.name

select
	c.name as 'Course',
	count(s.name) as 'Number of students'
from
	courses c
	join coursesStudentsJoinExample cs on c.id = cs.courseId
	join studentsJoinExample s on s.id = cs.studentId
group by 
	c.name
```
#### Self referencing join

```SQL

select Id, FirstName, LastName, Title, ReportsTo from company.employees;

select
	e.id,
	concat(e.FirstName, ' ', e.LastName) as 'Name',
	e.ReportsTo,
	concat(e2.FirstName, ' ', e2.LastName) as 'ReportsToName'
from 
	company.employees e
	left join company.employees e2 on e.ReportsTo = e2.Id
```
