## Microsoft.Data.Client

The old way of connecting to data bases in .Net
### [Connection strings](https://www.connectionstrings.com/)

Good website to find connection strings for different data bases.

### Code example

```C#
using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;

//Found on connectionstrings.com:
//TrustServerCertificate=True; Auto trust on certificate, shouldn't be done in real life situations.

var connectionString = "Server=localhost;Database=everyloop;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;";

//How to copy queries from SQL management studio directly
var query = """
select 
    * 
from 
    types;
""";

//SqlConnection class = Connecttion to DB
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
using (var command = new SqlCommand(query, connection))
{
    //Opens connection
    connection.Open();
    
    // Non select query
    // command.ExecuteNonQuery()

    //Sends command text to connection and returns a SQL data reader with all results
    using (var reader = command.ExecuteReader())
    {
        //Loop all columns
        for (int i = 0; i < reader.FieldCount; i++)
        {
            //Gets column name | Net type | Sql type :
            Console.WriteLine($"{reader.GetName(i),-20}{reader.GetFieldType(i),-20}{reader.GetDataTypeName(i)}");
        }

        Console.WriteLine();

        //First instance of read sets row to 0, advances one step every iteration,
        //returns true/false depending on if there is a row to read or not

        while (reader.Read())
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < reader.FieldCount; i++)
            {
                //Returns object
                Console.Write($"{reader.GetValue(i)}, ");

                //Returns string
                //Console.Write($"{reader.GetString(i)}, ");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
```

## ORM (Object relational mapping)

New way. (Entity Framework)

Converts tables to classes, rows to object, cells to properties

## SQL Injection

### Code Example

```C#
// SQL Injection
// Never concatenate user data with executable code, in this case sql code

using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;

var connectionString = "Server=localhost;Database=everyloop;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=true";

/*
 *  ' and 1 = 0 union select top 10 username, email, password from users; --
 */

using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();

    var searchString = string.Empty;

    while (true)
    {
        Console.Write("Enter new search string: ");

        searchString = Console.ReadLine();

        if (searchString == "") break;

        Console.Clear();

        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.DarkGray;
        Console.Write("Search string: ");
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
        Console.WriteLine(searchString);
        Console.ResetColor();

        SearchAirports(connection, searchString);

    }
}

void SearchAirports(SqlConnection connection, string searchString)
{
    // BAD! Opens up for Injection
    
    //var query = $"""
    //select top 10 
    //    [IATA], 
    //    [Airport name], 
    //    [Location served] 
    //from 
    //    [Airports] 
    //where 
    //    [Location served] like '%{searchString}%';
    //""";

    //Solves the problem!
    
    var query = """
    select top 10 
        [IATA], 
        [Airport name], 
        [Location served] 
    from 
        [Airports] 
    where 
        [Location served] like CONCAT('%', @searchText, '%');
    """;

    using (var command = new SqlCommand(query, connection))
    {
        //Adds SQL parameter
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@searchText", searchString);

        try
        {
            using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
            {
                Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.White;
                Console.WriteLine();
                Console.Write($"{reader.GetName(0).ToUpper(),-10}");
                Console.Write($"{reader.GetName(1).ToUpper(),-50}");
                Console.Write($"{reader.GetName(2).ToUpper()}");
                Console.WriteLine();
                Console.WriteLine();
                Console.ResetColor();

                Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Gray;

                while (reader.Read())
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"{reader.GetValue(0),-10}{reader.GetValue(1),-50}{reader.GetValue(2)}");
                }

                Console.ResetColor();
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
    }


    Console.WriteLine();
    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Blue;
    Console.WriteLine(query);
    Console.ResetColor();
    Console.WriteLine();

}
```
### [Command parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.parameters?view=netframework-4.8.1)


## ACID-transactions

Transaction: Ex: Move money from bank account to another

### ACID

ACID is implemented in DMBS by their developers. We as developers must secure that our code is
#### A - Atomicity

A transaction should be indivisible.

Either the whole transaction goes through, or not at all. If the transaction breaks before the transaction is completed the DMBS needs to restore all the changes that has been done (the state which it started in.)

#### C - Consistency

The database can't contain inner contradictions.

One talks about data integrity, and put up integrity terms that all data must comply to.

#### I - Isolation

Transactions mus be isolated from one another, even if they execute parallelly. One transaction's change can't be shown to the other transaction before the **whole** first transaction is completed.

#### D - Durability

When a transaction has executed correctly all updates and modifications must be stored in a resistant way.

### Commit / Rollback

#### Commit:
The command commit is used to the the DBMS that the transaction is completed and should be 
#### Rollback:
Undoes all changes made during the transaction.

```SQL

-- Starts transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
update newUsers SET UserName = '---' where FirstName like 'a%';
update newUsers SET UserName = '***' where FirstName like 'b%';

-- Commits transaction
COMMIT;

-- Roll back changes made since transaction started
ROLLBACK;

```

### Restore when crashing
If something crashes during transaction the DBMS needs to restore the data base.
#### Transaction log
For it to be able for the data base to roll back transactions (during crash or rollback command) it is required that it logs all changes made to something before it is committed. This is stored in .ldf file.
### Backup

You can also use the transaction log to recreate earlier transactions if needed.

If you backup data base every night, but the whole data base crashes (ex hardware malfunction) in the afternoon. If you restore the backup all transactions that happened during the day would be lost if you didn't have the transaction log.

With the transaction log (that should be written to another drive) you can recreate all the transactions that had been made during the day.

### Locks and blocks (Isolation)

To secure that all transactions are isolated from one another the DBMS has a lock mechanism. The DBMS locks the data objects it's supposed to update. Blocks the objects until the transaction is completed.

Can lead to performance issues if a transaction locks an object for a long time

### Deadlocks

When two transactions blocks each other a deadlock can occur where no transaction can finish, and thereby not unlock it's resources.

The DMBS has a solution for this.

**Always update objects in the same order to avoid deadlocks!**
