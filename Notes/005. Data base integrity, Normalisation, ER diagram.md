## Data integrity

Data in data base is joined together in a correct way without errors, gaps or contradictions.

When creating a data base you can set up constraints to tell the data base how, and which type of data can be stored. The data base will complain when the constraints are not followed.

### Common constraints

#### NOT NULL
A common constraint. You can choose whether or not columns can contain NULL values.

Syntax: Not null when declaring tables.
#### Unique
You can set constraint that all values in a column must be unique. Example: Each person in a table must have a unique social security number.

Can have one null value unless otherwise is set.

#### Primary key
A primary key is unique and not null.
Is set on a column to tell the data base which column is used to identify an unique row.

```SQL

CREATE TABLE constraintsDemo
(
	id int primary key, -- unique, not null
	firstName nvarchar(max) not null,
	SSN nvarchar(20) unique
	-- SSN nvarchar(20) unique not null
)

```
##### [Composite key](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/blog/composite-primary-key)
Primary key can be a composite of more than one columns

```SQL
CREATE TABLE compositeKeyDemo
(
	id int NOT NULL,
	firstName nvarchar(20) NOT NULL,
	SSN nvarchar(20) unique NOT NULL,
	primary key(id, firstName)
)
```
#### Foreign key
A table can contain one or more relation keys. They say that a columns is used as a reference to another table's primary key to show a relation between the tables. Therefore the DBMS can know which values
##### Update/Delete Rules
![Rules](bilder/Foreign_Key_Rules.png)
Can set different rules for updating/deleting
- No action: You can't update/delete primary key
- Cascade: You may now update/delete primary key, all rows linked to primary key via foreign key will be updated/deleted as well.
- Set NULL: Sets Null for the updated/deleted value
- Set Default: Sets default values for updated/deleted value

#### Check condition
With check we can set a term that must be followed for values on a column.

#### Default value
Sets default value for column when none is given

### Normalization (Guidelines for designing data bases)

#### Structure

Avoid redundant data!

Rule: One thing per table and one of those things per row.

Ex: A table contains books (not book AND authors), and each row contains information about one(1) book. The table should only contain information that is directly connected to the books.

#### Normalization

The process of adjusting ones tables by the normal forms is called **normalization**.

Normal forms:
Builds upon one another.
1NF, 2NF, 3NF and so on.

##### First normal form (1NF)

**The table should only contain 1 value per cell.**

One should avoid storing 'thing1, thing2, thing3' in a field, but instead choose to make 3 different columns, or store the things in another table and refer back to the original table.
##### Functional dependency

If the value of one (or more) attribute A without  problems set the value of attribute B, B is functionally dependent of A (a -> b)

A is determinant, since it decides b.

Title(A) -> Authour
Title(B) -> Pages
(Title, Format) -> Price

##### Second normal form (2NF)

2NF = 1NF + **No partial dependencies** -> all values (non-keys) depend on the entirety of each candidate key.

The book table has one candidate key, the composite key (Title, format) 

This is only actualized while using composite keys. 
2NF is used to avoid redundancy of data (unnecessary multiple occurrences).

##### Third normal form (3NF)

3NF = 1NF+2NF+ no "non key" attribute can be dependent on any other "non key" attribute in a table.

3NF is also a great way to remove data redundancy.

Genre_ID and Genre_Name are dependent on each other. Need to be put into another table to satisfy 3NF.

#### A word for the road

**Every attribute should represent one fact about the key, the whole key and nothing else than the key.**
