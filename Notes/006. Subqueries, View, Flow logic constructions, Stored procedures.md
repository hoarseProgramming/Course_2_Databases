## Subqueries

```SQL

SELECT
	subquery.Name,
	subquery.Email
FROM
(
SELECT
	concat(FirstName, ' ', LastName) as 'Name',
	Email,
	Phone
FROM 
	users
WHERE
	FirstName LIKE '[a-d]%'
) AS subquery
WHERE	
	LEN(Name) > 15

-- This is a way to avoid joins, but much slower
-- When subquery is dependent on data from the outer query, 
-- it needs to execute for each row in the outer query
-- Inner subqueries should be able to run on their own, otherwise performance issues.

SELECT 
	TrackId,
	Name,
	AlbumId,
	(SELECT Title FROM music.albums WHERE AlbumId = t.AlbumId)
FROM 
	music.tracks t

```

## View

```SQL

-- View (Vy)

-- Like table without it's own data.

DROP VIEW myView;

--CREATE VIEW myView AS
-- With schema binding. Now you can't alter the table structure
-- that the view references.
ALTER VIEW myView WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
SELECT
	concat(FirstName, ' ', LastName) as 'Name',
	Email,
	Phone
FROM 
	dbo.newUsers
WHERE
	FirstName LIKE '[a-d]%'
-- with check option: Now you can't insert rows into view that
-- don't fulfill where statement (in this case)
WITH CHECK OPTION
-- Go keyword = SSMS command
-- -> Separates commands in queries, executes separately
GO

DROP TABLE newUsers

-- You can insert into view. This updates the table behind the view.

```

## Procedural vs Set-based programming

### Procedural programming

Imperative programming - tell the computer to execute functions in a given order, one by one.
We give the compilator a long list of instructions telling it **HOW** we want it to do something.

## Set-based programming

SQL is a set-based language. It's constructed to manage a whole set of data

When giving a query to the DMBS we tell it **WHAT** it should do, not **HOW** it should do it.

### Flow logic constructions:
#### If - else
(Upsert)
IF EXISTS(select x) (Returns true/false if select generates values)
BEGIN( { )
END( } )
ELSE
BEGIN
END
#### while

DECLARE @count int = 0;
WHILE @count <= 10
	"Do something"
	SET @count = @count + 1;
BEGIN
END
#### Cursors

A way to iterate through recordset, the result of a select statement, row by row.

There are different cursors in SQL. One example:

##### FAST_FORWARD

DECLARE @id int;
DECLARE @name varchar(100);

DECLARE myCursor CURSOR FAST_FORWARD FOR
	SELECT id, name FROM paople;

OPEN myCursor;
FETCH NEXT FROM myCursor INTO @id, @name;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
	"Do something"
	FETCH NEXT FROM myCursor INTO @id, @name;
END;

CLOSE myCursor;
DEALLOCATE myCursor;
#### Loop problems in SQL

Performance issues. DMBS are built to work with set-based solutions.
Set-based solutions are faster in most cases.

CRUD operations can always be solved with set-based instructions.

## Stored procedures

```SQL

-- Stored procedure is a function stored in DB
-- Stored procedures can return values
-- We can't set data type, SP always returns int

-- CREATE PROCEDURE
-- Parameters, comma separated (name, data type)
-- Can have default values
-- Can have out data type that returns seomthing else than an int

ALTER PROCEDURE myProcedure @timestamp datetime = '2020-01-01', @name nvarchar(20) AS
BEGIN
	--PRINT @timestamp;
	--PRINT @name;
	DECLARE @now datetime = GETDATE();

	-- Return can be used in logic to stop procedure.
	RETURN;

	SELECT @timestamp as 'Timestamp',
	@now as 'Now',
	DATEDIFF(DAY, @timestamp, @now)  as 'Diff',
	@name as 'Name';

	-- Return is used as error codes
	RETURN LEN(@name);
END;

-- Run myProcedure, call upon with EXEC keyword
EXEC myProcedure '2024-01-01', 'Hampus';
EXEC myProcedure @name = 'Hampus';

GO
------------ SP 2 --------------

ALTER PROCEDURE random @rows int = 1, @total float OUTPUT AS
BEGIN
	--How to turn of messages with "Rows affected"
	SET nocount on;

	DECLARE @i int = 1;

	DECLARE @t table
	(
		n int,
		r float
	)

	WHILE @i <= @rows
	BEGIN
		INSERT INTO @t VALUES(@i, RAND());
		SET @i += 1;
	END

	SELECT @total = SUM(r) FROM @t;
	SELECT * FROM @t;

	-- Turn it off as well :-)
	SET nocount off;
END

GO

DECLARE @result float;

-- How to get return values from SP
EXEC random 5, @total = @result OUTPUT;

PRINT @result;
