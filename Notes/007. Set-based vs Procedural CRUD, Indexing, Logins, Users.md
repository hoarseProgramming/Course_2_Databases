## Difference in speed (Set-based vs Procedural)

```SQL

-- Difference in speed set-based programming vs procedural programming

CREATE TABLE demoData
(
	id int PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1, 1),
	timestamp datetime2 default(GETDATE())
)
GO

--Procedural solution #1
-- Sends 100.000 separate inserts from client to server ~ 20 sec

INSERT INTO
	demoData
DEFAULT VALUES
GO 100000

SELECT * FROM demoData


--Procedural solution #2
-- Sends script that does 100.000 separate inserts on server side ~ 10 sec

DECLARE @i int = 0;

WHILE @i < 100000
BEGIN
	INSERT INTO
	demoData
	DEFAULT VALUES
	set @i += 1;
END

-- Set based solution

-- Generate series gives values between two numbers
-- Just gets a constant by using getdate
-- One insert that sets 100.000 rows ~ 0.001 sec

INSERT INTO demoData(timestamp) select GETDATE() FROM generate_series(1, 100000)

-- Resets table + identity
TRUNCATE TABLE
	demoData;

```

## Indexing

### Heap tables

Stores unsorted data - a 'pile' of unsorted rows. When inserting new rows the new data can just be put on the pile -> A fast operation.

But, if you want to find a row with a specific value (where) the only solution for the DBMS is to look through **ALL** rows in the table to find the specific values.

This can be made faster with index

### Clustered index

In a table with a clustered index the data is sorted by index. You can only have on clustered index per table. All rows are sorted on the disk by a rule (column).

Index means that you have information about where in the table the data that we search for is stored. DBMS goes through a binary search tree to find the values.

### Non clustered index

While using a non clustered index we create a separate physical structure with a identical search tree as in a clustered index. The difference is that it doesn't search directly against the table data, but instead against a table of references to the table data.

You can have how many non clustered index as you want. Will add more data though.

### Indexes will add overhead

When inserting into clustered index, we will need to calculate where the new values will be placed in DB. Will take resources to save to disk.

Index isn't always a good idea. Need to be used when useable.

### Code example

```SQL
-- Heap table
CREATE TABLE indexDemo
(
	a int,
	b int,
	c int
)

INSERT INTO
	indexDemo
SELECT
	value,
	1000001 - value,
	ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 10
FROM generate_series(1, 1000000)

-- Algorithm that calculates hash for data, will always be the same for value
SELECT CHECKSUM('hello'), CHECKSUM('hell1')

--Primary key by default creates clustered index
CREATE TABLE indexDemo_pk
(
	a int PRIMARY KEY,
	b int,
	c int
)

-- non clustered index for b added by menu choice
CREATE TABLE indexDemo_pk_index
(
	a int PRIMARY KEY,
	b int,
	c int
)

-- non clustered index for b with c added by menu choice
CREATE TABLE indexDemo_pk_index_with_c
(
	a int PRIMARY KEY,
	b int,
	c int
)

-- Difference between non indexed / indexed tables

SELECT * FROM indexDemo WHERE a = 575000;
SELECT * FROM indexDemo_pk WHERE a = 575000;

-- Difference between non clustered index on b and no index for b
SELECT b FROM indexDemo_pk WHERE b = 575000;
SELECT b FROM indexDemo_pk_index WHERE b = 575000;

-- Difference between non clustered index on b and non clustered 
-- index on b with c added as column
SELECT c FROM indexDemo_pk_index WHERE b = 575000;
SELECT c FROM indexDemo_pk_index_with_c WHERE b = 575000;
```


## Security

You can set server roles and database roles for each login.

User mapping


Securables:

Can set access to certain objects.

Grant = Gives access
With grant = Also gives user ability to give other users right to get access
Deny = Always trumps access

Column permissions -> Can change access to certain columns in table

Also row level = **Row level security**

### Instead of giving read/write access

Create stored procedures for reading/writing.

Give access to view that shows all interesting data.

More control over what users can do in your data base

### Rule of thumb

Just give enough rights to the user so that they can solve what they need to be able to. Nothing more, nothing less
